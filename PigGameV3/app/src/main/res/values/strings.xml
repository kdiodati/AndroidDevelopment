        Pig is a 2 player dice game.
        The goal is to reach 100 points before the other player.
        When it is your turn you can roll the die or pass the die to the other player.
        If you roll a 1 then your turn is over and the other player is given the die.
        Otherwise you can keep rolling, until a 1 is rolled.
        If player 1 finishes first, player 2 gets one turn to beat player 1\'s score.
        HAVE FUN!
