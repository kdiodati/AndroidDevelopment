# kSoapWaterTempDemo
  A very simple app that demonstrates using the kSoap2-Android library to read from a web service. It reads the ocean temperature from a NOAA SOAP web service. The XML response from the web service is displayed in a TextView. (It isn't parsed).

Note: This app is just one app in the class demo repository. To get the source code for this app you will need to clone or download the whole repository, https://github.com/UO-CIS/CIS399AndroidDemos.

This demo was written for CIS399, Android App Development, at the University of Oregon.
