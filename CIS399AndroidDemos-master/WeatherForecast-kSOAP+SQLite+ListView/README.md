* WeatherForecast-SAX+SQLite+ListView
  * User selects forecast for a city using a Spinner
  * If the forecast data is in the database it is displayed, otherwise it is downloaded from a web service using kSOAP and stored in the database and displayed.
  * Displays forecast data in a ListView using a CursorAdapter
  * The web service, cdyne weather, is no longer being updated so the data is all old. This app should be updated to use a different web service.
